# EPK Workflow Implementation

## Overview

This application has been restructured to implement the Event-driven Process Chain (EPK) workflow as shown in the provided diagram. The EPK diagram shows the complete flow of an IT helpdesk system from ticket creation to completion.

## EPK Workflow Stages Implemented

### 1. Ticket Creation Entry Points

- **E-Mail-Anfrage geht ein** (Email request comes in)
- **Kunde ruft an** (Customer calls)
- **Kunde erstellt ein Ticket** (Customer creates a ticket manually)

All three entry points are handled through the `ticket_source` field in the ticket model.

### 2. Process Stages

#### Stage 1: Ticket Created (`ticket_created`)

- Initial ticket creation with basic information
- Customer details captured (name, email, phone)
- Issue description and type recorded

#### Stage 2: SLA Prioritized (`sla_prioritized`)

- Customer SLA level evaluated (Gold, Silver, Bronze, None)
- SLA priority calculated based on customer level
- Auto-response sent to customer

#### Stage 3: AI Categorized (`ai_categorized`)

- AI analysis performed on issue description
- Complexity detection (simple vs complex tickets)
- Password reset detection
- Priority calculation based on AI analysis
- Final priority calculated combining SLA and AI priorities

#### Stage 4: In Support Queue (`in_support_queue`)

- Tickets assigned to appropriate level (L1 or L2)
- Complex tickets automatically routed to L2
- Queue assignment based on priority and complexity

#### Stage 5: Being Processed (`being_processed`)

- Support agent starts working on ticket
- Status changed to "in_progress"
- Solution steps tracked

#### Stage 6: Awaiting Customer (`awaiting_customer`)

- When customer response is needed
- Status changed to "waiting_customer"
- Customer notification sent

#### Stage 7: Solution Provided (`solution_provided`)

- Issue resolved by support team
- Resolution notes recorded
- Status changed to "resolved"

#### Stage 8: Feedback Requested (`feedback_requested`)

- Customer feedback requested
- Rating system (1-5 stars)
- Comment collection

#### Stage 9: Completed (`completed`)

- Final stage after customer feedback
- Ticket closed
- Process completed

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Data Model

- **Process Stage Tracking**: Each ticket tracks its current stage in the EPK workflow
- **Solution Steps**: Detailed audit trail of all actions taken
- **Customer Feedback**: Rating and comment system
- **Automation Flags**: Tracks auto-responses, password resets, escalations

### 2. AI-Powered Analysis

- **Complexity Detection**: Automatically identifies complex tickets requiring L2 support
- **Password Reset Detection**: Identifies password-related requests for automation
- **Priority Calculation**: AI-based priority scoring (1-5)
- **Suggested Solutions**: AI provides initial solution recommendations

### 3. Automated Processes

- **Auto-Response System**: Immediate customer acknowledgment
- **Smart Routing**: Automatic assignment to L1 or L2 based on complexity
- **Password Reset Automation**: Automated handling of password requests
- **Escalation Rules**: Automatic escalation of complex tickets

### 4. Workflow Management

- **Process Stage Advancement**: Manual and automatic stage progression
- **Bulk Operations**: Mass automation actions for efficiency
- **Pending Action Monitoring**: Dashboard for pending automations
- **Workflow Statistics**: Real-time metrics and analytics

## API Endpoints

### Ticket Management

- `GET /api/tickets` - Enhanced filtering by stage, priority, SLA level
- `POST /api/tickets` - Creates ticket with full EPK workflow initialization
- `PUT /api/tickets/:id` - Updates ticket with workflow stage management
- `POST /api/tickets/:id/feedback` - Customer feedback submission
- `GET /api/tickets/stage/:stage` - Get tickets by specific stage

### Workflow Management

- `POST /api/workflow/advance-stage/:id` - Advance ticket to next stage
- `POST /api/workflow/trigger-automation/:id` - Trigger specific automation
- `GET /api/workflow/stats` - Get workflow statistics
- `GET /api/workflow/pending-automation` - Get pending automation actions
- `POST /api/workflow/bulk-automation` - Bulk automation operations

### AI Services

- `POST /api/ai/analyze` - Enhanced AI analysis with complexity detection
- `POST /api/ai/generate-response` - Auto-response generation
- `GET /api/ai/health` - AI service health check with feature status

## Frontend Components

### 1. Workflow Page (`/workflow`)

- Visual representation of EPK process flow
- Stage-by-stage ticket counts and metrics
- Pending automation actions dashboard
- Bulk operation controls

### 2. Enhanced Ticket Forms

- Updated to capture EPK-required fields
- Customer contact information
- Issue type and source tracking
- SLA level selection

### 3. Process Monitoring

- Real-time workflow statistics
- Process stage distribution charts
- Customer satisfaction metrics
- Automation effectiveness tracking

## Automation Rules

### Auto-Response Generation

- **Simple Requests**: Standard acknowledgment with expected resolution time
- **Complex Issues**: Escalation notification with L2 assignment
- **Password Resets**: Immediate reset instructions

### Escalation Logic

- Complex tickets → L2
- High priority (4-5) → L2
- Gold/Silver SLA with priority ≥ 3 → L2
- Network issues → L2

### Process Progression

- Auto-advancement through early stages
- Manual control for customer interaction stages
- Automatic completion after feedback

## Benefits of EPK Implementation

1. **Standardized Process**: Clear, repeatable workflow for all tickets
2. **Automated Efficiency**: Reduced manual work through intelligent automation
3. **Better Customer Experience**: Faster responses and more accurate routing
4. **Improved Metrics**: Detailed tracking of process performance
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to extend and modify workflow stages

## Future Enhancements

1. **Integration with Email Systems**: Direct email ticket creation
2. **Phone System Integration**: Automatic ticket creation from calls
3. **Advanced AI Features**: Natural language processing for better categorization
4. **Mobile App**: Customer self-service portal
5. **Integration APIs**: Connect with external systems (Active Directory, etc.)

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready EPK workflow system that can handle the full lifecycle of IT support requests from creation to completion.
